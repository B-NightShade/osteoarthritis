This project is Python and was run in Jupiter notebook

This projects goal was to try to classify x-ray images and test how accurate it was compared ot trained x-ray techs
This project was run on the universities super computer because the last few models were slow on a personal machine
The overall accuracy at its best was 66& for the models I was working with

I choose this dataset as my final project because the applications of software in the health care system has always been an area of intrest to me. This dataset was interesting
to me because it dealt with knee x-rays that we could feed into a nueral network. X-rays themselves are not something easy to read so it was a fun puzzle trying to get
the computer to be able to read them with any sort of accuracy.

This course was my first time working with machine learning models. After learning more in my internship with Matrix I plan to come back to this project and see where I could
make improvements in the models accuracyand percision. I spent two weeks on this project and it was an individual final project.
