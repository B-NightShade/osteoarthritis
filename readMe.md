# Osteoarthritis - machine learning models in Python

## dataset
[datasetLink] (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/56rmx5bjcr/1 "dataset")

## description
* This project was written in Python and was run in Jupiter notebook
* The final models were run on the Universities super computer
* Overall accuracy achieved was 66% in two weeks of work

This projects goal was to try to classify x-ray images and test how accurate it was compared ot trained x-ray techs

## about dataset
I choose this dataset as my final project because the applications of software in the health care system has always been an area of intrest to me. This dataset was interesting
to me because it dealt with knee x-rays that we could feed into a nueral network. X-rays themselves are not something easy to read so it was a fun puzzle trying to get
the computer to be able to read them with any sort of accuracy.

### Future improvements
This course was my first time working with machine learning models. After learning more in my internship with Matrix I plan to come back to this project and see where I could
make improvements in the models accuracyand percision. I spent two weeks on this project and it was an individual final project.
